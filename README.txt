The Problem at Hand
A local school is in need of some new software to allow their students to see available classes, as well as make their own schedules. They also need advisors and administrators to be able to see information that has been submitted. Admins will also need to be able to enroll new students into the software.

My solution to this problem was to develop a python application that provides students with their own portion of the application to submit and view available classes. Administrators can view additional information, as well as submit new student users and interact from every view. This application utilizes two different database files and hosts bootstrap styles.
